```

## Current Status

âœ… **Frontend App**: Complete React TypeScript Vite project with TanStack Router, chord transposition, font controls, and dual-mode display

ðŸš§ **Gateway**: Nginx reverse proxy (planned)
ðŸš§ **API**: Node.js server (planned)
ðŸš§ **Shared Packages**: Common types and utilities (planned)
ðŸš§ **Docker Setup**: Single container deployment (planned)

## Development Guidelines

1. **App Independence**: Each app should be independently deployable
2. **Shared Code**: Common functionality goes in `packages/shared/`
3. **Consistent Tooling**: Use same linting, formatting, and testing tools across apps
4. **Docker First**: All apps should be containerizable
5. **Documentation**: Each app has its own `AGENTS.md` for specific details
